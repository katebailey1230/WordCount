# WordCount
  An open-sourced project to add MANY features to in Python.

  This is my first Open-Sourced Project so please comment as much as you'd like!

  This project was created to give you a sense of how many words you're using in a
  specific line of text. This may be advantageous to you if you are editing a
  draft of a paper and need to know what words are used too frequently, and
  other word options to use.

  This is an open-source project designed using Django 2.02 and Python 3.6.
  Contributions can, and should, be made to the <a href="nola321.pythonanywhere.com">WordCount site</a> via <a href="https://github.com/katebailey1230/WordCount">GitHub.</a>


  Below is a great source for how to make a contribution, in general, if you're a newbie, like me!
